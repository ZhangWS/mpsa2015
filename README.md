##Directory Guide:
1. mpsa2015undirected.nlogo : Code for the paper. Use NetLogo 5.2.0. 
2. raw data/: repository containing runs from ~15000 iterations at various settings of the model. So far, there are two runs, the first with codebook, full data cleaning and some (but disorganized) analysis code. The second has code but is as yet uncleaned, as it reported more readings than run 1.
