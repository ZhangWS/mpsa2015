Please contact the owner of this repository with regard to NetLogo code and data cleaning/analysis procedures.

##Directory Guide:
1. mpsa2015undirected.nlogo : Code for the paper. Use NetLogo 5.2.0. 
2. simulationrun1/: repository containing data from ~15000 iterations at various settings of the model (small world and scale-free network types only). Run 1 contains a codebook, full data cleaning and some (but disorganized) analysis code. 
3. simulationrun2/: repository containing data from run 2. Run 2 does not yet contain a full codebook, as the second run included added reporting variables. They are fairly intuitive to infer if you consult the run 1 codebook. **Please note that there is a mismatch on low N, specifying Small World N = 120 and Scale Free N = 125. This should not affect your data analysis, but be aware when subsetting or specifying settings.
