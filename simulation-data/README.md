Authors: W Zhang, L. A. Caughell and A. B. Cronkhite

##How to use this directory:

This directory contains the data that we harvested from ~15000 simulations of the NetLogo model found in the top level directory.

1. RAW DATA FILES: "scalefree2.csv" and "smallworld2.csv"
	These were custom generated by NetLogo and were very hard to read.

2. DATA CLEANING FILE: "datacleaning.R"
	This will clean and extract raw data from files in (1) into readable machine format.
	
3. READABLE DATASETS: "scalefree2data.csv" and "smallworld2data.csv"
	These files are machine readable by your statistical program of choice without breaking anything.
	
4. CODEBOOK: "codebook.txt"

5. DATA ANALYSIS CODE: ""
	This file will generate all tables and figures in the current version of the manuscript. 
	
6. EXTRANEOUS: ""
	These files include extra data analysis procedures that were suggested but not needed for the manuscript. They are included in case someone would like to conduct extra analyses of the existing data.
