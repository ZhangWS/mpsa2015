*"Agent-based modeling (ABM) and the Dissemination of Erroneous Information: A viral explanation of rumor propagation"*

Authors: W Zhang, L. A. Caughell and A. B. Cronkhite

This paper was formerly known as *"Did Hillary Clinton throw a lamp or did Harry Reid get into a fistfight? Agent-based modeling (ABM) and the Dissemination of Erroneous Information"* and was presented at the 2015 MPSA Annual Conference.

The current manuscript version is currently under review at the *Journal of Politics*.

##Directory Guide:
1. mpsa2015undirected.nlogo : Simulation code and replication run settings for the paper. The code was written in NetLogo 5.2.0 and will run best on NetLogo 5+, as the Networks extension was revamped for NetLogo 5. Your syntax mileage may vary if you use any lower versions of NetLogo.

2. paper/: manuscript directory containing the current version of the manuscript. A slightly previous version of this (sans copy-editing as done by the repository owner recently) is under review at the Journal of Politics. The previous MPSA version of this manuscript and the associated Powerpoint presentation is available upon request, but really, this version is much better and clearer.

3. simulation-data/: data directory containing simulation data that was used for the paper analysis. This direcory contains a full codebook, data cleaning code and data analysis code. The short analysis code can generate all figures and tables used in our paper, while the long analysis code is an annotated smorgasbord that may be useful to you. 

**Please note that there was a mismatch on the low N simulation setting. I accidentally specified Small World N = 120 and Scale Free N = 125. This should not affect your data analysis, but be aware when subsetting or specifying settings.
