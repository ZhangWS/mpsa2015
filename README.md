Prepared for 2015 MPSA Annual Conference.

Please contact the owner of this repository with regard to NetLogo code and data cleaning/analysis procedures.

##Directory Guide:
1. mpsa2015undirected.nlogo : Code for the paper. Use NetLogo 5.2.0. 
2. simulationrun1/: repository containing data from ~15000 iterations at various settings of the model (small world and scale-free network types only).Run 1 contains a codebook, full data cleaning and some (but disorganized) analysis code. 
3. simulationrun2/: repository containing data from run 2. Raw data only, no cleaning or analysis procedures as of yet, mostly due to the fact that there are more settings reported per run. You can try to clean the data by hacking the datacleaning.R file from simulationrun1/ or wait until I do it.

Please note that the data analysis portion of this paper is currently being redone with run2 data.
